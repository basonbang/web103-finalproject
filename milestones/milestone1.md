## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The project brainstorming process was fast and simple, and allowed us to think creatively about what we wanted in our app. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We faced issues gathering all the features, and communicating with each other to get this milestone done in time. We were not able to decide as a group what we wanted to work on in time. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We need more communication methods - perhaps some weekly meetings, where we can discuss the direction of our project or actively work on it.
